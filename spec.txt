Craft Beer Brewer: I am a craft brewer who has been making beer in my home for the last 5 years.
As a new business owner I need a way to keep track of my inventory so I can plan which beer to make next.
Because I am a small business, I make a reltively small batch and sell it in its entirity.

I would like to record the beer name, the type of beer, and the alcohol by volume (ABV) to the nearest tenth of a percent.

I would also like to know what season the beer was marketed for, the date it was made, and the date it can ship on.
All beer needs to sit for 42 days after it was made before it can be shipped.

To simplify the reporting for myself, I have given each type of beer I make a numerical code to match:
1:Lager
2:IPA
3:Stout
4:Porter

Questions:

Q: What is the maximum ABV of a beer you would produce?
A: Most beers I brew are between 2 and 3 ABV but some of my seasonal beers are as high as 8.5

Q: What is the maximum ammount you have sold your beer for?
A: I usually make only 1 or 2 kegs of a beer at once and they sell for anywhere between $60 to $100 each but occasionally I will get a request to make more for a larger event.
   I will never make more than 6 kegs of one beer.

Q: Would you ever have a batch which doesn't sell and is stuck in stock?
A: I usually only make a beer when I get a request for it but occasionally requests get cancelled after I've started brewing and I can't find a buyer.
   When this happens I give the beer out to my friends so it doesnt' go bad. Nothing sits for longer than 2 weeks after the date it can ship.

Q: Do you get paid in advance for making a batch of beer?
A: No. I am only paid when the beer ships.



Reports:
1. Show me a list of all the beers waiting to ship and how long they still have to sit before I can ship them.
2. I would like to know which seasons sell the most beer. Show me the number of kegs I sold per season ordered from most sold to least sold.
3. Show me how much I money I made in the last year selling beer
